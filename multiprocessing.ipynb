    "'''differences between multiprocessing and multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Multiprocessing: In multiprocessing, multiple processes run concurrently, and \n",
    "each process has its own separate memory space and Python interpreter. \n",
    "These processes can run on multiple CPU cores, allowing true parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: In multithreading, multiple threads run within the same process and \n",
    "share the same memory space and Python interpreter. \n",
    "Threads are lighter-weight than processes but are subject to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, \n",
    "which can limit true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Multiprocessing: Processes are isolated from each other, \n",
    "meaning that one process's memory or resource issues are less likely to affect other processes. \n",
    "This isolation can enhance program robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: Threads within the same process share memory and resources, \n",
    "which can lead to issues like data race conditions and thread interference if not properly synchronized.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Multiprocessing: Offers true parallelism by utilizing multiple CPU cores effectively,\n",
    "making it suitable for CPU-bound tasks or tasks that can be easily parallelized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: Limited by the GIL in CPython, which allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. \n",
    "This means that multithreading may not provide as much performance improvement for CPU-bound tasks\n",
    "as multiprocessing does. However, it can still be beneficial for I/O-bound tasks where threads can perform other \n",
    "activities while waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Multiprocessing: Inter-process communication (IPC) is used for communication between processes. \n",
    "This typically involves mechanisms like queues, pipes, or shared memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: Threads can easily share data and communicate with each other through shared variables and \n",
    "data structures. However, this also increases the complexity of managing thread synchronization to avoid race conditions. "
